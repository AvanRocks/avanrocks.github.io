  One day, I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGccIFf6MF8">this Youtube video</a> 
  where a guy shows how he made a machine that winds string around a bunch of pegs arranged
  in a circle and the string ends up recreating a photograph of an eye.
  </p>

  <p>
  Go watch the video, it's really cool.
  </p>

  <p>
  So it turns out that this type of art is a thing, and it's called 'string art'.
  Some people make this sort of art by hand, by winding a string around the pegs manually.
  There are two hard parts about making string art.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
    One is deciding which pegs to wind the string around and it what order.
    </li>
    <li>
    The other is the labor of winding the string thousands of times.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  The guy in the video made both of these steps easier.
  He wrote code to decide how to wind the string and built a machine to do it.
  </p>

  <p>
  I thought this idea was cool so I wanted to try making my own string art.
  Since I lack the hardware skills to make a machine, I decided to simulate making string
  art by drawing it on the screen.
  You can check out the code <a href="https://github.com/AvanRocks/string-art">on my Github</a>.
  There's a README there that explains how to build the program and use it yourself.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Here's how my string art program recreated an image of some random man's face I found online.

  Again, check out the <a href="https://github.com/AvanRocks/string-art">github page</a>.
  It has more demo images and a short explanation of how the code works.
